          <h4>What is a Wide Angle Lens?</h4>
          <p>
            A "wide angle" lens is any lens with a short focal length. Focal length is the distance, in millimeters, from the optical center of your lens to the film or sensor when your lens is focused at infinity.
          </p><br></br>
          <p>
            Whoa, that's a little intense, right? Practically speaking, the important thing to remember is this: the shorter the focal length of the lens, the wider the field of view, and the more you'll be able to fit in your frame. Some common wide-angle focal lengths for 35mm SLR cameras, from very wide to moderately wide, are 14mm, 20mm, 24mm, 28mm, and 35mm.

            Here's a great lesson on focal length and field of view from David Bode's course, <strong>What Every Photographer Should Know About Lenses.</strong>
          </p>


          <h4>What does a wide angle lens do?</h4>
          <img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/4/3805/32676461530_55b52f2f23_o.jpg" alt="wide_angle_2" />
          <p><strong>Wide angle lenses distort things and enhance perspective.</strong></p>
          <p>
            What that means is that <strong>objects closer to the camera appear larger than ones farther away,</strong> even if they are the same size in reality.
          </p>
          <p>
            Look at the image of the underground sign on the right; notice how much larger the end closest to the camera appears compared to the end farther away. This is wide angle lens optics at work. Same with the image of the Brooklyn Bridge (top) and the buildings in the images below.
          </p>
          <p>
            Any subject with straight lines will appear to converge faster than the eye perceives normally. Buildings come to a peak as you look up, railway tracks disappear into the distance quickly, and so on. Learn to use this to your advantage when shooting with a wide lens.

            Adding depth and a sense of inclusion also occurs when using a wide angle lens. You feel like you’re more part of the scene, in the image, than those shot with longer telephoto lenses.
          </p>
          <h4>How do you use a wide angle correctly?</h4>
          <p>
            Knowing when and how to use a wide angle lens is the key to creating successful images that draw your viewers in, making photos that get the “wow” response you seek.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let’s look at the four mistakes beginners make using a wide angle and how you can correct each of them for more powerful images.
          </p>

              <h4>Everything in the image is equal distance from the lens</h4>
              <p>
                To use a wide angle correctly, to its advantage, you need to have something close to the lens.
              </p>
              <p>
                Look at the size of the tractor in the two images. Notice how large the tractor looks compared to the grain elevator. See how the size relationship has changed in the second image? The tractor did not move from one shot to the other, nor did the distance between them change. The only things that changed were the lens I used, and the subject to camera distance.

                That may seem intimidating, but you can’t be anonymous or invisible when you’re shooting wide.
              </p>
              <p>
                In order to make your shots more interesting, have more depth and perspective – you have to get closer. Try and get a subject really close to your lens, something else a medium distance away, and the background even farther.
              </p>
              <p>
                This will give your image layers of depth and make people want to look at it closer, to really explore what’s going on in your photographs.

              <h4>No clear subject in the image</h4>
              <p>
                As soon as you get close enough to make the subject larger – it will start to stand out. So part of getting a clear subject is getting in tight.
              </p>

              <p>
                Consider the above image, notice there is no clear subject for the viewer to land on? Now, have a look at the image below with a nail sticking out as the focal point.
              </p>
              <img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/307/33017109926_0dfd411e47_o.jpg" alt="wide_angle_13" />

              It’s better, but then I noticed a yellow leaf sticking out of the rotten boards. Even better it was backlit by the sun so it really stood out.
              </p>
              <p>
                See how it becomes the focal point of the image?
              </p>
              <p>
                Not just because it’s large in the frame, but it’s also off-centered, has dramatic light on it, and is a bright warm color that draws the eye. All things working in my favour.
              </p>

              <h4>Taking unflattering photos of people</h4>

              <img src="https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/513/33058963395_36be9a9961_o.jpg" alt="wide_angle_15" />
              <p>
                This is generally not a good look for most people. If you want to photograph a person and flatter them, simply do not use a wide angle lens. However, that doesn’t mean you shouldn't use wide angle lens for any people photography completely. You just need to understand the effect it will produce and use is wisely.
              </p>
              <p>
                Use a wide angle lens to take photos of people that show their environment, add a sense of fun or even humour, or tell a story.
              </p>
